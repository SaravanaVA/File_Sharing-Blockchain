On Monday, we were treated to the first teaser trailer for Peter Jackson-produced Mortal Engines adaptation – based on Philip Reeve’s book of the same name – which is set thousands of years in a post-apocalyptic environment, where cities have gone mobile to make the most of scattered resources. Mortal Engines rolls in December 14, 2018.
